# RandomNumberGenerator

After many assignments using a different random number generator to the one available in C++'s stdlib, which was written in C (with an greatly improvable implementation, the seed was a global variable you could modify anytime), I've decided to implement it as a C++ class where the seed is a non-mutable private member with bigger projects, like my degree's thesis, in mind.

## Structure

RandomNumberGenerator is very simple.
You just need to include `random.hpp`, which contains the class's headers and its inline member functions.

## Testing

You can build a quick test with `make` from `test/main.cpp`. How to use it:

```shell
bin/test [seed]
```
- `seed` : optional parameter that sets the generator seed. Must be un integer.
